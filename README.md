# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis




# Overview of Pewlett_Hackard
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.



## **Analysis Results**

We found that by there are a total of 1708 employees eligible for the mentorship program.
All employees that are members on this list are current employees who are born in the year 1965.

## **Analysis Summary**
Overall, it is safe to say that we need the eligibility program to help the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees. About 2,000 roles will need to be filled over a span of 3-5 years before the effects of retirement become an issue for Pewlett-Hackard. 
With around 33,000 total employees, it is a concern that there may be too many employees to assign a mentor and it would help to have more employees in the mentorship program to accommodate for the large amount of employees.
